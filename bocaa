The best part about these restaurants is that you can create your own signature meal in the game. As interesting as that may sound, not all restaurants come with high-end menus and fresh ingredients.

For instance, you can put things into suitcases, then pick up the suitcase and put it in somebody’s hand.

For instance, the Hospital also includes the lair of a mad scientist, who appears to be making all sorts of sloth hybrids, many of which you’ll find scattered throughout the app. (There seem to be a lot of sloths in the Toca Boca apps.) But you’ll have to figure out where the lair is—and even when you find it, it’s a bit tricky to get inside. "
